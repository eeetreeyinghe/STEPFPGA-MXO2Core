### About the codes in this repository
This repository of Verilog codes are accompanied with the tutorial book ***An Experimental Discovery of Digital Circuits Implemented by FPGA*** for the STEPFPGA board. For Chapter 5, each folder contains All-in-one style and Separate style of coding.

- The All-in-one style integrates all modules into a single and long Verilog code, for quick demo or experiment purpose, you simply copy & paste the single file in your IDE tool and synthesis. 
- The Separate style is more structural and has complete codes for all sub-modules being used. Most of the submodules are compatible with the modules you used in Arduino projects.  

In all folders of Chapter 5, you noticed a **xxxxx.JED** file there. This is the final implementation bitstream file which you can simply drag into the STEPLink flashdrive, and the program automatically burns in. Using the pin definitions are specified in the pin-mapping images, you should be able to setup the demo.

Nevertheless, if you are totally new to FPGA, all these stuff still make no sense to you, so the best way is to learn the systematic knowledge from fundamentals and go step by step until you are comfortable to play all these projects. 

Enjoy a pleasant FPGA journey with this simple but power board, and of course, the tutorial and kits.
